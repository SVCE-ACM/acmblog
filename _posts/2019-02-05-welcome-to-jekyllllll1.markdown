**<center>The Follow Through: Enriching Athletes Lives Through Awareness</center>**  

**Background &amp; Problem**  
From an early age athletes exist in a different environment than the rest of society. The expectation to devote the majority of one’s youth to sports is enormous. Too many of young athletes are raised in circumstances of poverty and family strife. Those lucky few who make the leap from amateur to the professional leagues can earn a lucrative contract and fame. These accomplishments often come with a heavy price; working in an ultra-competitive environment filled with extreme pressures from family, friends, coaches, agents, and the media. All of this contributes to less than an ideal atmosphere for positive professional and personal growth.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The daily news teems with the pressures of the sports industry engulfing the athlete; drunk driving charges , spousal abuse , steroids and performance enhancing drugs , bankruptcy and the “club” lifestyle , and at its most tragic, murder  and/or suicide . “The Follow Through” aims to change the nature and culture of the professional sports industry and positively influence athlete’s lives.

**<center>Solution Proposal</center>**
The name “The Follow Through” was chosen because it signifies that life is more than sports for athletes; while they are working to make good on the promise of their talents, they must follow through in their personal life too. They must become well-rounded human beings with healthy control over their thoughts and emotions.

**What Do We Want to Accomplish?**   
“The Follow Through” is dedicated to raise awareness of resources that enable athletes to enhance the social, emotional, and financial quality of their personal and professional lives. In the “macho” culture of sports, it is imperative to de-stigmatize the informal rule that athletes are “weak” for seeking help to resolve quality of mind and life problems.  We want to do this through utilizing transformative, generational change for individuals, professional sports leagues, and society itself.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fundamental strategy for “The Follow Through” is to provide educational resources to individuals about who to reach out to in a time of need.This education will take the form of spreading a critical and valuable message to athletes and society that it is not only natural to seek help in time of crisis, but that it is essential for an individual persons well-being. Transformative change takes a long time to develop and reach full potential, because the goal is to alter the informal rules of how a society functions. I am confident this initiative will generate positive change in the short-term as athletes will begin to realize that help is available and it is normal to seek it.

**Funding**  
“The Follow Through” will raise money through fundraising efforts and service fees. In the beginning, we will seek startup capital through angel donors, government/private grants, and a crowd-sourcing campaign. Our preferred strategy is angel donors and a major reason why we will target the NFL first with our services. The NFL is a wealthy association, with many periphery branches that generate high profit. All it takes is one current or former stakeholder or group of stakeholders  (players association, coaches, or the commissioner, etc.) to write a check and lend gravitas to this issue. Having a contingency in case this does not happen is important. “The Follow Through” will also pursue grants and crowd sourcing while pitching angel donors. Along with these strategies, we are also developing a plan to collect service fees for connecting athletes with trusted professionals who will aid them in their time of need.

**First Steps**  
The 30, 000-foot view of this benefit is exciting to talk about, but the road to transformative change is paved with little steps. In order to move forward with this important service, legal and marketing logistics need to be well thought out and executed properly.  

These include, but are not limited to:

* Incorporating “The Follow Through” as a 501(c) 3 not-for-profit organization in the District of Columbia.
* Securing a domain name, an internet hosting plan for the aforementioned name, and quickly but tastefully designing an online home.
* Networking with as many potential champions for change and professionals with similar interests as possible, in order to develop relationships that will result in partnerships with us in our mission for change.

**Champions for Change**  
Continuing to build on these first steps we need to cultivate professional relationships with qualified:  

* Psychologists
* Psychiatrists 
* Life skill/financial advisors
* Religious organizations 

Concurrently, building a network of professional athletic champions for our mission will ensure that our profile will be raised and be respected as a voice in the sports arena. We are seeking active and retired notable NFL players, coaches, and other stakeholders whose football credentials hold considerable weight to carry our message through the media and across the country. 

**The Message**  
Our message is simple: 
><strong>“There are underutilized resources available to athletes that will enhance the success of their personal and professional lives.”</strong> 

This will start with a focused and dynamic push to professional NFL players. Amateur (NCAA) and youth leagues will follow once we’ve built a solid foundation for our message. Our efforts include but are not limited to:  

* Breaking down the “macho culture” of silence denial amongst players.  
* Building awareness of these helpful resources:
  * Psychology and psychiatry   
  * Life skill coaches
  * Independent, respected financial advisors
  * Religious organizations

**The Service**  
As our narrative of available positive resources takes shape and gains traction among players, media, and the general public, we will be building relationships with qualified professionals in psychology, psychiatry, and life/financial advisors. These individuals and organizations will be vetted through a rigorous process that prizes experience, quality, and confidentiality. These professionals will then be on call through us for athletes where they can be assured they will receive assistance from a person they can trust to help them while keeping their name and issues confidential through the process and afterwards.

**Conclusion**  
Given the excessive amount of so many ugly and avoidable personal tragedies in football, “The Follow Through” will provide a vital benefit. To some degree the emotional turmoil encountered by many athletes and the solution to these endemic issues are being discussed on a sporadic basis. What is needed is a sustained and impactful dialogue that positively alters the modern athletes’ perception of seeking and obtaining professional and qualified solutions to their personal crises. “The Follow Through” aims to provide the foundation for this type of change and beyond that, follow through with the necessary resources to sustain long, lasting change.
